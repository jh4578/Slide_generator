Ltd., Shanghai, China, and it is an oral vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor. In clinical trials, fruquintinib has demonstrated a survival benefit in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of fruquintinib in real-world patients. We collected data from patients with mCRC treated with oral fruquintinib from 2018 to 2020 in six different institutions. Patients with mCRC initially received 5 mg of oral fruquintinib daily for 3 weeks. Progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The efficacy and safety of fruquintinib were also assessed. Seventy-five patients were involved in our study, and 29.3% of patients achieved stable disease (SD). Median PFS was 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.841-5.959). The treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with fruquintinib were acceptable with grade 3 TEAEs of 6%. The grade 3 TEAEs were hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), fatigue, and stomatitis. The ECOG performance status was associated with PFS. In this real-world study, the clinical activity of fruquintinib was consistent with what has been reported in previous clinical trials. The level of safety was acceptable, and the side effects were manageable.",

In addition, the formation of new blood vessels provides a convenient route for metastatic spread 8 . The VEGF/VEGFR system is the most important pathway leading to angiogenesis, which can stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, thereby promoting  new  vessel  tube  formation  and  migration 9 .  In tumor  tissue,  tumor  cells  can  produce  VEGF  by  oncogenic  activation  or  through  loss  of  tumor  suppressor function 10,11 and  by  hypoxia  condition  or  changing  glucose  concentrations 12 .

      "content": "There are two major approaches that have been developed  to  target  the  VEGF/VEGFR  signal  pathway.  One is  VEGF  or  VEGFR  neutralizing  monoclonal  antibodies, while the second approach is small-molecule inhibitors  of VEGFR tyrosine kinase activity. The successful example  is  the  anti-VEGF-A  antibody  bevacizumab (Avastin;  Genentech  Inc.),  which  has  been  approved for advanced mCRC in the first- and second-line setting combined with chemotherapy 18 . However, there are problems in the use of bevacizumab including immunogenicity and intravenous administration among others. There are several VEGFR small-molecule inhibitors, including regorafenib  (Stivarga;  BAY  73-4506;  Bayer  Healthcare Pharmaceuticals Inc., Wayne,  NJ,  USA) 19 , sunitinib (Sutent; Pfizer, New  York, NY, USA) 20 , sorafenib (Nexavar; BayerHealthCare, Montville, NJ, USA; Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Emeryville, CA, USA) 21 , and pazopanib (Votrient; GlaxoSmithKline, Middlesex, England) 22 . Unfortunately, these agents have relatively low selectivity, as they can inhibit more than 10 kinases. As a result, they  have  significant  off-target  effects  and  are  associated with significant side effects and limited anticancer efficacy. Fruquintinib is a highly selective angiogenesis inhibitor and was developed by Hutchison MediPharma for the treatment of solid tumors 23 . In 2018, fruquintinib received its first approval by the China Food and Drug Administration  (CFDA)  for  the  treatment  of  mCRC patients after two prior systemic therapies. Fruquintinib selectively  targets  the  tyrosine  kinases  associated  with VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3, and it  has  demonstrated clinical activity and good tolerance levels 23 . In the phase Ib trial (NCT01975077), fruquintinib showed excellent pharmacokinetic characteristics, tolerable safety,  and  antitumor  activity  in  various  tumor  types 24 . The  median  PFS  was  5.8  months,  and  the  median  OS was 8.88 months. In the phase II trial (NCT02196688), fruquintinib  treatment  in  mCRC  was  associated  with  a PFS of 4.73 months and a median OS of 7.72 months 25 . In the phase III clinic trial (NCT02314819), patients receiving fruquintinib treatment significantly improved PFS and OS in advanced mCRC 5 . The median OS in the fruquintinib  treatment  group  was  9.3  months,  and  the  median PFS in fruquintinib  was  3.7  months.  In  this  real-world study, the median PFS was similar to what was previously reported in the phase II trial (NCT02196688) 25 and longer than that described in the phase III trial (NCT02314819) 5 . This  difference  may  be  attributed  to  the  more  rigorous enrollment  eligibility  criteria  used  in  the  clinical  trials.",

As  patients returned after a short follow-up period, we could not collect enough 'outcomes' for OS. PS is known as a strong prognostic factor in patients with mCRC 26-28 . Worsening PS has been associated with poor prognosis, which we have  confirmed  in  our  study.  In  the  present  study,  PS was identified as the main independent factor for PFS. Patients with poor PS had shorter PFS. We were unable to identify any other predictive and/or prognostic factors for PFS.

Three  mCRC patients  started  with  an  oral  dose  of  4  mg  given  their baseline characteristic of having only a single kidney and advanced age. Two patients needed dose reduction to 4 mg because of HFSR and fatigue. Compared to the FRESCO trial,  where  131  patients  (47.1%)  required  interruption or dose reduction with fruquintinib treatment, a significantly smaller number of patients in our study required dose reduction. It seems that compared to the FRESCO trial, patients in our study tolerated fruquintinib well in the primary doses. This result might be due to the fact that follow-up time in our study was short. Therefore, a longer follow-up period in patients with fruquintinib treatment should be done in future analyses.",

The reasons for this discrepancy are still unclear. This finding may be the result of  different  baseline  factors  in  our  study.

One limitation of our current study is that it represents only a small sample size of patients with mCRC. All included patients  who  received  fruquintinib  were  those deemed  appropriate  for  treatment,  which  might  not  be possible for all patients with mCRC.

In real-world situations, fruquintinib  treatment is  associated  with  survival  durations  in  cancer patients similar to those reported in randomized controlled trials.

The therapeutic effect of regorafenib is commonly associated with thyroid dysfunction. A similar trend toward improved OS was also observed in mCRC patient treated with regorafenib who experienced the drug-related hypothyroidism. In a prospective single-centre study, the median OS was longer in  patients  with  symptomatic  hypothyroidism  than  in  those with  subclinical  hypothyroidism  (19.2  vs  9.4  months,  P= 0.012)  or  with  euthyroid  status  (19.2  vs  4.7  months,  P= 0.001). 7 In  our study, patients  with  fruquintinib-induced hypothyroidism showed a greater median OS than euthyroid patients, and the median OS was 17.6 months vs 10.2 months (P=0.25). The mechanism of TKI-induced hypothyroidism is yet to be addressed in the clinic. Studies have displayed that VEGF inhibition might take a crucial part in the development of hypothyroidism. Inhibition of VEGF with increasing TSH levels  might  result  in  capillary  regression  in  the  thyroid. 7,8 Another possible mechanism for thyroid hormone synthesis interruption was associated to the presence of thyroid peroxidase antibody. 9 Similarly, hypertension has been indicated as a  predictive  factor  for  longer  survival.  According  to  earlier findings, 10,11 the development or worsening of hypertension suggested  a  response  to  sunitinib,  another  tyrosine  kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR, and favourable outcome in metastatic renal cell cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumours.
