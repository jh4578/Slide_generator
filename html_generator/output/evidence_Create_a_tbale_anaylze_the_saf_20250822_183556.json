Ltd., Shanghai, China, and it is an oral vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor. In clinical trials, fruquintinib has demonstrated a survival benefit in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of fruquintinib in real-world patients. We collected data from patients with mCRC treated with oral fruquintinib from 2018 to 2020 in six different institutions. Patients with mCRC initially received 5 mg of oral fruquintinib daily for 3 weeks. Progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The efficacy and safety of fruquintinib were also assessed. Seventy-five patients were involved in our study, and 29.3% of patients achieved stable disease (SD). Median PFS was 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.841-5.959). The treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with fruquintinib were acceptable with grade 3 TEAEs of 6%. The grade 3 TEAEs were hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), fatigue, and stomatitis. The ECOG performance status was associated with PFS. In this real-world study, the clinical activity of fruquintinib was consistent with what has been reported in previous clinical trials. The level of safety was acceptable, and the side effects were manageable.",

The  most  common grade  3-4  TEAEs  (incidence  >5%)  observed  in  8%  of patients were hypertension, HFSR, fatigue, and diarrhea. In  the  phase  II  trial,  the  grade  3-4  TEAEs  (incidence >5%)  observed  in  61.7%  of  the  fruquintinib  treatment group were hypertension and HFSR. Dose reduction or treatment interruption for TEAEs occurred in 61.7% of patients treated with fruquintinib, and HFSR and hypertension  were  the  most  common TEAEs in the fruquintinib  treatment  group.  In  the  phase  III  trial,  the  safety of  fruquintinib  treatment  in  cancer  patients  was  further studied.  The  most  common TEAEs  were  hypertension, HFSR,  proteinuria,  and  dysphonia.  Grade  3-4  TEAEs were observed in 46% of patients who received fruquintinib  treatment.  The  most  common  grade  3-4  TEAEs (incidence >5%) were hypertension and HFSR.",
