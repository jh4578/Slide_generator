      "content": "Fruquintinib, also called HMPL-013, was first discovered by Hutchison Whampoa Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China, and it is an oral vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor. In clinical trials, fruquintinib has demonstrated a survival benefit in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of fruquintinib in real-world patients. We collected data from patients with mCRC treated with oral fruquintinib from 2018 to 2020 in six different institutions. Patients with mCRC initially received 5 mg of oral fruquintinib daily for 3 weeks. Progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The efficacy and safety of fruquintinib were also assessed. Seventy-five patients were involved in our study, and 29.3% of patients achieved stable disease (SD). Median PFS was 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.841-5.959). The treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) with fruquintinib were acceptable with grade 3 TEAEs of 6%. The grade 3 TEAEs were hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), fatigue, and stomatitis. The ECOG performance status was associated with PFS. In this real-world study, the clinical activity of fruquintinib was consistent with what has been reported in previous clinical trials. The level of safety was acceptable, and the side effects were manageable.",
